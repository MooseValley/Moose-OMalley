# About me: Moose OMalley

* I live on my own, on 100 acres of land in a dilapidated old farm house that needs a hell of a lot of work.  The nearest neighbor is Km's away.  I love the peace and serenity and living close to nature.  The land was a pineapple farm when I purchased it in 2004, and was 95+% cleared of all trees.  However, I have encouraged the trees to grow back since then while also encouraging native wildlife: kangaroos, echidnas, goannas, snakes, birds, koalas, emus, wombats, and everything else to come back and live on the land.  I regularly see kangaroos hopping past.  

* My long term aim for my land is to setup a Nature / Animal / Vegetation Reserve and to give a safe home to all native animals that want to live here, as well as any other animals that may need help: horses, donkeys, llamas, alpacas, cows, goats, piggies, chickens (chooks), etc.

* Very interested in clean energy, renewable energy, fusion power, etc.
