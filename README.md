# About me: Moose OMalley

* I live a simple life with my fur kids (my pets) in an old farm house that needs a hell of a lot of work.  The nearest neighbor is miles away.  I love the peace and serenity and living close to nature.

* The land was a farm and mostly cleared of all trees.  However, I have encouraged the trees to grow back while also encouraging native wildlife: kangaroos, echidnas, goannas, snakes, birds, koalas, emus, wombats, and everything else to come back and live on the land.  I regularly see kangaroos near my house.

* Originally, my plan was to setup a clean energy / renewable energy farm, invite schools to visit and learn about renewable energy, and create a minor tourist attraction for the region.  However, this idea met with an extremeley negative response when I invited all neighbours within a 5 Km radius to a meeting to discuss renewable energy and my plan to create a renewable energy farm.  Sadly, NIMBY Syndrome - **N**ot **I**n **M**Y **B**ack **Y**ard - raised its ugly head.  All neighbours hated the ideas.  One threatened: "<i>if you put one solar panel on your barns roofm, I;m going to complain to the countil that you are industrialising the country side</i>".

* My long term aim for my land is to setup a Nature / Animal / Vegetation Reserve and to give a safe home to all native animals that want to live here, as well as any other animals that may need help: horses, donkeys, llamas, alpacas, cows, goats, piggies, chickens (chooks), etc.

* Very interested in clean energy, renewable energy, fusion power, etc.
